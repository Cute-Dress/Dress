WHY???
--------------
In short: We're encouraging more people to learn and understand the ideology of GitHub without coding. 

There are quasi-programmers and non-programmers who need to participate in collaborative projects. So it's exactly suitable to practice in this project because no coding skills are required here.

Will this project take up a lot of GitHub resources?
---------------
No.

Contributors are required to compress their photos before making pull requests. Photos which are larger than 1MB per file or don't meet our standard will be rejected. It's also considered to be a training course of GitHub workflow for them.

In the future, we might clean orphaned objects regularly to keep the availability of the repo.

Is this project really helpful?
---------------
Yes, we think.

This project has already gained attention about GitHub and taught lots of people 
"the ideology and the workflow of GitHub" and "how to use GitHub simply" in an easy-to-understand way.

This project has also developed users' team cooperation ability: Join the discussion and solve problems such as 
forking, merging branches, controlling the size of repos, maintaining repos, and so on.

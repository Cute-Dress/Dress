name: fast-forward for PR
# GitHub doesn't support fast-forward merge of PR, 
# which causes GPG signatures overriden by GitHub's key.
# This workflow allows maintainers to do a fast-forward merge
# by replying anything containing `/fast-forward` to the PR.
#
# Contributors must first rebase onto the latest commit before PR to make fast-forward possible.
